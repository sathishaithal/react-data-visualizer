# React CSV Upload Application

## Overview

This application is a ReactJS-based frontend that allows users to:
1. Upload files (CSV or any format).
2. Validate that the uploaded file is a CSV.
3. Display an error for invalid files.
4. Parse the CSV using PapaParse.
5. Proceed to a chart page after successfully uploading a valid CSV file.

The project utilizes React-Redux for state management and React Router for navigation. Tailwind CSS is used for styling.

## Features
